# Finalv3

This week I worked on moving everything to a new Workbook.  This way it has a much cleaner look.  It also is much easier to add more data in this way with everything next to eachother.  I also added more data in this week and pushed my final figure to an html file so I can show that at the final presentation to once again make it cleaner.

The main failing I have had so far is when it comes to the amount of data. I am not sure whether I already have enough data or whether to keep going.  I also have been having trouble collecting the data as people either say they will and then forget or don't feel comfortable sending their personal data.  Finally I am having trouble with the "color" aspect of my Parallel Categories chart as I cannot get it to work with string data points.

Up next I am planning on continuing to clean up and add more data, as well as think about changing up the color scheme.
